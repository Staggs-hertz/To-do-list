# 🗒️ Enhanced To-Do List App

This project started as part of my **Full-Stack Web Development** udemy course by Angela Yu.  
It was originally a simple to-do list built with EJS and JavaScript for basic CRUD operations.  
I’ve since improved it by adding more features and expanding its structure to make it feel like a complete app.
